Compiling
---------

This version of furl uses the Autoconf and Automake. On UNIX-like hosts try the following:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ su
# make install

On Windows ( >= Windows 95 ) there are configuration files in the Win32 sub-directory for compiling with:

Mingw32 - mingw32.bat
Borland C++ - borland.bat
MS Visual C++ - vcmake.bat

Change directories to the Win32 sub-directory and run the applicable batch file.

It is also possible to cross-compile using Mingw32 on GNU/Linux by altering the Win32/Makefile.mingw32 file.
